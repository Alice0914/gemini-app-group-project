There are multiple use cases where this is beneficial. LangChain has a base MultiVectorRetriever which makes querying this type of setup easy. A lot of the complexity lies in how to create the multiple vectors per document. This notebook covers some of the common ways to create those vectors and use the MultiVectorRetriever.\n","\n","The methods to create multiple vectors per document include:\n","\n","- Smaller chunks: **split a document into smaller chunks**, and embed those (this is ParentDocumentRetriever).\n","- Summary: **create a summary for each document**, embed that along with (or instead of) the document.\n","- Hypothetical questions: **create hypothetical questions that each document would be appropriate to answer**, embed those along with (or instead of) the document.\n","\n","Note that this also enables another method of adding embeddings - manually.

The caveat is important - I’ve heard of a well known company\\nthat had an o\\x00shore team handling lots of manual customer work (ie responses). And this\\n“product” had a ~50% g ross margin.

There are many\\nlimiters here - data security and compliance are big ones. But even more important right now is\\ncost. At the end of the day, these large language models are quite expensive! And as a vendor\\nusing them, you can either pass through the costs to your end customer (to maintain your gross\\nmargins), or eat the costs and lower your gross margins (because the customer isn’t willing to pay\\nthe incremental cost for incremental functionality brought about by AI), and hope the model\\nproviders lower their costs in the future. It seems like every company has been experimenting.\\nSaying things like “just build out all the AI functionality now and then we’ll evaluate if\\ncustomers will pay for it.” Now that we’re getting through this initial wave of experimentation\\nand AI buildout, there’s quite a bit of sticker shock when the OpenAI bills come due!

As AI becomes more widespread, the demand for raw silicon is likely to increase.\n* **Model providers:** The second layer of AI monetization is model providers. These are the companies that develop and sell the AI models that are used to power AI applications. As AI becomes more sophisticated, the demand for model providers is likely to increase.\n* **Infra:** The third layer of AI monetization is infra. This includes the software and services that are used to build and deploy AI applications. As AI becomes more complex, the demand for infra is likely to increase.\n* **Durable Applications:** The fourth layer of AI monetization is durable applications. These are the AI applications that are used to solve real-world problems. As AI becomes more widespread, the demand for durable applications is likely to increase.\n\n**Investment Advice**\n\nBased on the trends discussed above, I believe that there are a number of investment opportunities in the AI space.\n\n* **Raw silicon:** I believe that there is a strong investment opportunity in raw silicon.
